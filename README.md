The rapid growth of video content on YouTube presents a challenge in identifying
which videos are likely to trend based on user engagement metrics. Understanding the factors
that contribute to a video becoming trending can help content creators, marketers, and analysts
optimize their strategies. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model
capable of predicting whether a YouTube video will trend, using features such as views, likes,
dislikes, and comment count. To address this problem, we will implement and evaluate the
performance of four machine learning algorithmsâ€”Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Random Forest, and XGBoost. These algorithms will be trained on a dataset containing
video metadata and user interaction metrics to classify videos as trending or non-trending. The
accuracy and reliability of these models will be assessed based on several performance metrics,
including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. The project aims to
compare these algorithms in terms of their ability to generalize and handle the classification
task effectively, identifying which model provides the highest accuracy and best captures the
underlying patterns of trending videos. Additionally, we will explore the reasons behind the
varying performances of the models, considering factors such as algorithm complexity, feature
interactions, and data distribution. The goal is to select the most suitable algorithm for
predicting trending videos on YouTube, providing insights into the dynamics of online content
virality. Furthermore, by analysing these predictive capabilities, we hope to offer content
creators actionable recommendations that can enhance their video strategies and improve
overall engagement rates.
